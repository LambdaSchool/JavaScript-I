# JavaScript - I

* The point of these assignments is to take your knowledge of JavaScript and start putting into practice the principles learned throughout JavaScript I.

## Assignment Description

- [x] Fork/Clone this repository.
- [x] Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
- [x] Use `console.log()` statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.
- [x] To test your `console` statements you can either run `node /assignments/<fileName>` and see what prints in your terminal. You can also use an online tool like `JSBin`, `REPL.it`, `JSFiddle` or even your `Chrome developer console`.
- [x] Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork. 

### Objects
To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The [objects.js](assignments/objects.js) file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills answer vital questions for HR.

- [x] Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges. 
- [x] Complete each challenge presented before moving on to Arrays.
- [x] Complete Objects Stretch Challenge.

### Arrays
The [arrays.js](assignments/arrays.js) assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars.  You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory.  Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.

- [x] Utilize the array `inventory` to complete your challenges
- [x] You are not permitted to use map, reduce, or filter to solve these problems.  Only use a basic for loop.
- [x] Complete each challenge presented before moving on to stretch.

### Stretch
- [ ] Move on to tomorrow's content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.
- [x] Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.
